### Evaluation Examples

[[CardiganBay]] is written in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), a language which I'm a big fan of, and want to use for scripting within the wiki.

There are two ways to embed Clojure code in your wiki.

* evaluation on the client
* evaluation on the server

In both cases, the code needs to be correct (without bugs or causing exceptions). And can't use external resources or include libraries etc.

### Evaluation in the Browser

At the moment there is a particular Workspace card into which the viewer can type Clojure code and have it evaluated. Full details are on  [[WorkspaceExample]]

There is also [[GraphingExample]] which shows you how to implement a simple "graphing calculator" using a workspace.

### Evaluation on the Server

The card-types :evalraw and :evalmd allow us to embed Clojure code in a page which is run on the server when the page is assembled.

:evalraw evaluates the code and returns the result as a raw string, to be rendered as returned. 

:evalmd assumes that the code returned will itself be in markdown format and therefore should be run through the markdown renderer.

The next cards have examples of :evalraw and :evalmd
----
:evalraw
(map 
  #(str % ",") 
  (filter even? (range 10)))

----
:evalmd
(map #(str "* Item number **" % "**\n") (range 10))

----
:evalmd
(str "This is some text with a link to [[SandBox]]")

----
:evalmd
(for [x (range 10)] 
   (str x ",," (* x x) ",," (* x x x) "\n")
)

### IMPORTANT

**Please note that we don't do any security checking of Clojure to be run on the server, so this is a security risk. Don't run Cardigan Bay on a server where you think it might be accessible to hostile, Clojure-aware agents.**

Right now, Cardigan Bay is only recommended for private machines or protected private networks.

Unlike client-side evaluation, server-side code will be evaluated during exports.
