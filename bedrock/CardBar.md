[[CardiganBay]] pages are made of cards.

By default you simply see a rendered content of the card. But you'll also see at the bottom right corner of each card, a small eye icon.

Click it an you will open the "Card Bar" of extra information and functionality about the card.

Currently this includes both the Source Type and the Render Type of the type of the card and the "hash" of the card. This is a unique number (in fact a [hash number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)) which is used to identify the card. 

Current extra controls for manoeuvring cards include "Send to Another Page". Simply fill in the input with the name of another page, and hit the send button. The card will be moved to the next page.

There are also up and down arrow buttons, for reordering the cards on the page, by moving the card up or down.
