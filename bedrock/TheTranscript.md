The Transcript is a space showing the results of dynamic interactions with [[CardiganBay]], such as the results of searches or executing short pieces of Clojure code.

The idea and name is inspired by the transcript in the Smalltalk environment. Though it's also like the output on a text terminal. Over the course of a session with Cardigan Bay, the transcript builds up, so you can always look back and see the results of earlier searches and calculations. However, the transcript is **not** saved between sessions. So anything important should be copied to a page.

Currently things appear in the transcript as a result of actions made on [[TheNavBar]]. In future other actions might also write to the transcript.

When in the transcript mode, the normal page is hidden, but you can click the [Return] button to leave it. You can also switch to or from the transcript on the top main menu.
